**Step 1** <br>
[Download data](https://nuwildcat-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mfn2245_ads_northwestern_edu/EU9glLqMxHtOiAmaHzsw4nEBvccaIEKsslrS14rQC7odcg?e=3amqNy)<br>
What's in here? <br>
A few images are included for when we build our StoryMap at the end

<br>

**Step 2** <br>
Let's go to the [ArcGIS Online homepage](https://northwestern.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html) <br> 
Content page <br>
Let's add in data. We'll be working with EPA data on toxic superfund sites around the US. <br>

<br>

> **Step 3** <br>
> Adding data - a few ways we can do this <br>
>> We can add layers through our Content Page
>>> Good to get used to this when you're dealing with a larger datasets

<br>

> **Step 4** <br>
> *MAP 1 - Make a porportional dot symbology map*
> <br>
>   Map Page Basics <br>
>     `Tool Bar (Save, Add Data, Analysis) <br>
>     Data frame/Map extent<br>
>     Navigation <br>
>     Can't change your projection in AGO - all data is projected into Web Mercator <br>`
>   Basemaps <br>
>   Table of Contents <br>
>   <br>
>   Add superfund sites through "Add Data" <br>
>   Make a dot symbology map based on site score <br>
>   **Try this on your own:** Change basemap to Light Gray <br>
>   Save map

<br>

> **Step 5** <br>
> *MAP 2 - Make a choropleth map*
> <br>
> **Try this on your own:** <br>
> 	Add counties <br>
>	Add point data <br>
> <br>
> Tool: Summarize Data > Join Features <br>
> `Join one to one <br>
> Keep all target features <br>
> Check out Attribute Table` <br>
> 
> **Try this on your own:** <br>
> While your feature is running, you can do other things - maybe change basemap, or bring in layers from Living Atlas. <br>
> <br>
> Configuring pop-ups
> <br>
> Save map


> **Step 6** 
> *MAP 3 - Enrichment Analysis / Bivariate choropleth map* <br>
> Add Census tracts <br>
> Tool: Data Enrichment > Enrich Layer <br>
> 	Add Income and Education variables <br>
> Add labels of county name with a halo <br>
> <br>
> Save map 

<br>

> **Step 7** <br>
> *MAP 4 - Newark Hospitals and Buffer Analysis* <br>
> **Try this on your own:** <br>
> 	Add counties <br>
> Add hospitals using csv <br>
> 	Filter to Essex county <br>
> Tool: Find Locations > Derive new locations <br>
> 	Superfund sites intersect nj_boundaries <br>
> Tool: Use Proximity > Create Buffers <br>
> 	Buffer hospitals by 1 mile <br>
> <br>
> Save map

<br>

> *Creating a StoryMap*
