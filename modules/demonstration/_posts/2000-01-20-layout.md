# **Step 2** <br>
Map Page Basics <br>
* Zoom, Navigation <br>
* Basemaps || Can't change your projection in AGO - all data is projected into Web Mercator <br>
* Content Pane <br>
* Save your Map <br>
> *Try on your own:* Change the basemap to Light Gray Canvas

<br>

# **Step 3** <br>
Let's add in data, a few different ways:
1. ArcGIS Online
     * ACS Poverty Status Variables
3. Hosting through Content
     * Chicago Community Boundaries + Grocery Stores (2013) from the [Chicago Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)<br>
     * Check out our [GIS Research Guide](https://libguides.northwestern.edu/gis) for data resources <br> 
> *Try on your own:* Bring in another data layer from ArcGIS Online and check out the attribute table. Save your map!

<br> 

# **Step 4** <br>
Now let's jump into using some spatial tools! <br>
1. Tool: [Aggregate Points](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/analyze/aggregate-points.htm) <br>
2. Tool: [Enrich Neighborhoods](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/analysis/enrich.htm) <br>
       * Make a [bivariate map](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-living-atlas/mapping/multivariate-maps-what-are-they-and-how-can-i-make-them-in-arcgis/) <br>
> *Try on your own:* Enrich your map with another variable, then try making another bivariate map.
