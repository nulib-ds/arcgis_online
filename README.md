# Introduction to ArcGIS Online workshop
This workshop was made using the [P2PU Course-in-a-box](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/) template. We host our workshop data through OneDrive and will provide a link in the workshop info email.

> The goal of this workshop is to familiarize yourself with basic webGIS concepts and identify what resources are available to you at Northwestern. 

The Geospatial and Data Services Team at Northwestern University Libraries is dedicated to helping you with your geospatial analysis, visualization and data management needs.
